# Banker-s-Algorithm
This assignment involves the implementation of the Bankerâ€™s Algorithm, a deadlock avoidance technique
designed for systems with multiple instances of each resource type. The algorithm evaluates system safety
by analyzing resource allocation, maximum process demands, and available resources to ensure that the
system remains in a safe state before granting resource requests. The implementation will read input from a
structured file ( input.txt ), process allocation and need matrices, and dynamically handle user-initiated
resource requests. Each request will be validated to determine whether granting it maintains system safety,
ensuring deadlock prevention.
